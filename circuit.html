        We created our game from an Arduino Uno, a joystick, a 16x2 LCD, a button, a
        1 Kilo Ohm resistor, a breadboard, and wires. The coding language we are using
        is C++. Our game uses the power from our computer for the Arduino microcontroller
        using assigned digital and analog pins to help us send commands to each part of
        the game.

        The LCD and joystick both connect to different analog pins. The LCD connects
        SDA to Analog pin 4 and the SCL pin on the LCD connects to Analog pin 5. It is important to note that a library is required to use the LCD. Once downloaded, initialize the library for the LCD with the I2C address and dimentions of the display to use the LCD. As
        for the joystick, it connects to the Arduino through the UV pins; UVy is
        connected to analog pin 2 and UVx is connected to analog pin 1. This means when the joystick recieves an input (a tilt on the x or y axis) it will send a signal to the Arduino. The Arduino will then send a signal to the LCD which will display the output (the corresponding direction the heart moves).

        In this section of the schematics, when the push-down button is pushed, power will pass through the button and flow towards digital pin 2 into the
        Arduino. As a result, when the button is pressed, pin 2 reads HIGH allowing the Arduino to tell the LCD that the user is trying to patch a crack.

        In our circuit, the 1 Kilo Ohm resistor acts as a pull down resistor. This means when the push-down button is not pressed, pin 2 is connected to GND and will read LOW. The resistor is used to avoid current flowing into ground when the button is pressed to avoid a short circuit. This happens because electrons travel the path of least resistance so they don't flow through the high-value resistor into the ground. The joystick is used to provide analog input for the
        Arduino so that you can move the heart across the LCD. Our circuit uses 5
        volts of power through the Arduino Uno. The analog inputs allow us to read
        the position of the joystick, and the digital input reads the state of the
        joystick button.
