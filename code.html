        This block of code is the initializing of variables. These variables
        keep track of the values stored inside the game to make it work. Some
        of these values include the current position of the heart, the position
        of the cracks, the speed of the cracks forming, scores and more that
        keep the game running.

        This block of code is for the visual images of the heart and the
        crack on the LCD. They use binary to tell the LCD which pixel needs
        to be turned on and which needs to be turned off. 1 represents the
        on pixels while 0 represents the off pixels.

        Here in void setup(), we set our pins and LCD. We assign the pin mode
        of the pins as input, clear and turn on the backlight of the LCD. We
        also assign random seed to A0 so we can use random numbers to randomize
        the placements of the cracks.

        Here is the start of your void loop(). First, we check if the user
        has already lost. If not, we can continue with the game. Next, we
        check if the joystick is being moved. If it is, we check which way
        it is being moved and add or subtract one from the row or column
        depending on the direction the joystick is being moved.

        This code checks if the repair button has been pressed. When it has,
        it cycles through the positions of the cracks it see if it matches the
        current positions the heart is on. If they do, it removes the crack from
        that spot and shuffles all the coordinates in crackCols and crackRows
        list down. It also adds to your score.

        This code determines how fast the cracks spawn. levelTimer is the timer
        that counts how long it takes for the cracks to start speeding up the
        rate they spawn. Which is every 60 iterations of the code. waitTimer is
        the time in between each crack. In the beginning, one crack spawns with
        every 20 iterations. Every time the levelTimer reaches 60, the time between
        each crack decreases by 5 iterations. We also check if the crack count is
        less than 10. We spawn a new crack if it is, and if it's over the user loses.

        This code is for if the user has played at least one round already and
        lost. If a new high score has been made, then the high score is updated
        and displayed for the user to see. When the repair button is clicked, a
        new game starts, resetting some of the variables used in the game.

        Here is the code for the home screen of the game. This is for when the
        game has just been opened and is showing the title of the game. The delay
        at the end is so that when the game starts, the heart is not moving so
        quickly that it is difficult to control.
