  <!-- Introduction paragraph explaining the project -->
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to our summative website! For this summative project, we were tasked with using our
    knowledge and skills that were developed throughout this course to create a circuit-based program which utilizes
    peripheral devices. This program would be developed using the C++ programming language to program physical circuit
    and our robot. For this assignment we decided to create a robot that will [insert description] We call it 
    <i>Helper Bot</i>. <br>
