  <!-- Introduction paragraph explaining the project -->
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to our summative website! For this summative project, we were tasked with using our
    knowledge and skills that were developed throughout this course to create a circuit-based program which utilizes
    peripheral devices. This program would be developed using the C++ programming language to program physical circuit
    and our robot. For this assignment we decided to create a robot that will be controlled by a controller on the 
    Dabble app, light up in the dark based off the inputs of an IR sensor, control light brightness using a 
    potentiometer, and backup when too close to an object based off a VL53L0X sensor. We call it <i>Helper Bot</i>. <br>

          Manoush was responsible for building majority of the physical circuit
          and programming some of the components to ensure they work correctly.
          Additionally, Manoush was responsible for creating and editing a demo
          of the circuit in action as well as creating the circuit illustration.
